# COVID-19 Analysis and Prediction: A Modified SEIR infectious Model
In this project, a modified SEIR infectious model is used to predict the case of COVID-19 in US.

# Approaches
* [SEIR model](https://docs.idmod.org/projects/emod-hiv/en/latest/model-seir.html#:~:text=The%20SEIR%20model%20assumes%20people,return%20to%20a%20susceptible%20state)

* [Least Square](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.least_squares.html#scipy.optimize.least_squares)
